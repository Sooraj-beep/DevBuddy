# DevBuddy
Easily manage and keep track of your technical projects
# The Problem
I often come up with super cool project ideas while doing mundane things like taking a shower or grocery shopping and often wished there was a convenient way to formulate these ideas and take them down quickly before I forget them. Sure, you could use a notes app on your phone but I think if you are working with software projects, you would prefer a much better way to create and track these ideas right from your phone. That is where DevBuddy comes in.
# Overview
